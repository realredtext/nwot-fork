Custom Roles Feature

There exist 3 states for users - Public, Member, Owner
In order for a user to have a role, it must be a member of a world.
Configurations on the world config page override all settings.
Custom permissions can be set to each role, including managing roles, managing world, etc.
Tile protections can be set to only one role type. Properties can be managed, such as who can type.
Precise char requires special encoding for roles.
